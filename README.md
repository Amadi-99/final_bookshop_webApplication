# final_bookshop_webApplication

The main objective of the project is to create an online book shop that allows 
users to search and purchase a book online based on title, author and subject. The 
selected books are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their books 
online through credit card payment. Using this Website, the user can purchase a book 
online instead of going out to a book store and wasting time.

I develop a website using “Mern Stack” with MongoDB, Express, React, 
NodeJS. Online Book shop is an online web application where the customer can 
purchase books online. Through a web browser the customers can search for a book by 
its title or author, later can add to the shopping cart and finally purchase using credit 
card transaction. The user can login using his account details or new customers can set 
up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name, contact number 
and shipping address. The books are divided into many categories based on subject like 
Biography, Children and Fiction etc.
